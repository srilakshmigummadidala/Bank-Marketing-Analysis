## Executive Summary

This project revolves around enhancing term deposit subscription campaigns for a bank through data-driven strategies. Key insights were derived by exploring a diverse dataset comprising customer details. Notable findings include the age distribution of customers, default status, account balance patterns, and the impact of previous marketing campaigns. Categorical variables such as job roles, marital status, and education levels were analyzed to understand dominant categories. Feature engineering and machine learning models were implemented to predict subscription outcomes. 

Despite efforts like hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved an accuracy of 90%. Conclusions emphasize the importance of targeted marketing and recommendations include exploring advanced modeling techniques for further improvement.
